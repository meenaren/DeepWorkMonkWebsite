# Product Context: Migrated Book Recommendations Page

**Problem Solved:** The original content is hosted on Buy Me a Coffee, which might not be the desired long-term platform or might lack customization options. Migrating to GitHub Pages provides a free, customizable, and developer-friendly hosting solution.

**How it Should Work:**
- The page should display the blog post content about recommended books.
- It should include the title, main text, section headings, and book cover images.
- The layout should be simple and readable.
- Navigation elements specific to Buy Me a Coffee (like login, start a page, support buttons) should be removed.
- Links associated with the book images should be preserved if possible, or removed if they are affiliate links not intended for the new context. (Decision: Preserve the original links associated with the images).

**User Experience Goals:**
- Provide a clean, focused reading experience for the blog post content.
- Ensure the book cover images are clearly visible.
- The page should load reasonably quickly.
