# Progress: Book Recommendations Page Migration

**Current Status:** Initial HTML page created

**What Works:**
- Core Memory Bank files have been created.
- Project goals and context are documented.
- `index.html` created with migrated text content.
- Basic embedded CSS styling applied.
- Resized images from `resized/` directory are included in `index.html`.
- Original links added to book cover images in `index.html` based on user feedback.
- Main title (`<h1>`) alignment changed to left based on user feedback.

**What's Left to Build:**
- Local review of `index.html`.
- GitHub repository setup and configuration for GitHub Pages (User Task).
- Committing and pushing project files (`index.html`, `resized/`, `memory-bank/`) to the repository (User Task).

**Known Issues:**
- None at this stage.

**Evolution of Project Decisions:**
- Initial decision to use embedded CSS for simplicity.
- Initial decision to omit external links from book images was revised based on user feedback; links have now been added.
- Title alignment changed from center to left based on user feedback.
