# Progress: Book Recommendations Page Migration (Jekyll Site)

**Current Status:** Jekyll site structure identified; Migrated content exists as a post. Memory Bank updated.

**What Works:**
- **Jekyll Structure:** Basic Jekyll site structure is in place (`_config.yml`, `Gemfile`, `_posts`, `_layouts`, `_includes`, `assets`).
- **Migrated Content:** The book recommendation content exists in `_posts/2025-04-28-books-i-recommend.html`.
- **Images:** Resized images are correctly placed in `assets/images/books/`.
- **Image Links:** Original external links were added to the images within the post file.
- **Memory Bank:** Core files created and updated to reflect the Jekyll architecture and current understanding.

**What's Left to Build/Verify:**
- **Verify Post Rendering:** Confirm the post content (`_posts/2025-04-28-books-i-recommend.html`) renders correctly using the assigned layout (`_layouts/post.html`) and styles (`assets/css/style.scss`).
    - Check image paths (`/assets/images/books/...`).
    - Verify title alignment adjustment within the Jekyll context.
- **Local Preview (Recommended):** Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to preview the site locally, specifically the book recommendations post page.
- **GitHub Pages Deployment (User Task):**
    - Set up GitHub repository.
    - Configure for GitHub Pages deployment.
    - Commit and push all necessary project files.

**Known Issues:**
- None identified, but verification of the post rendering within the Jekyll environment is pending.

**Evolution of Project Decisions:**
- **Initial Misunderstanding:** Project was initially treated as a single static HTML file.
- **Discovery:** Identified the project uses Jekyll based on file structure and `index.html` content.
- **Memory Bank Correction:** Updated `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, and this file (`progress.md`) to reflect the Jekyll architecture.
- Image links were added based on user feedback (decision remains).
- Title alignment was adjusted (needs verification in Jekyll context).
