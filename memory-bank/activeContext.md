# Active Context: Initial Migration Setup

**Current Focus:**
- Adjusting the alignment of the main title (`<h1>`) in `index.html` to left-aligned based on user feedback.

**Recent Changes:**
- Created core Memory Bank files.
- Created initial `index.html`.
- Added original links to book cover images in `index.html`.
- Updated relevant Memory Bank files (`productContext.md`, `progress.md`).

**Next Steps:**
1. Modify the CSS rule for `h1` in `index.html` to remove center alignment.
2. Update `progress.md`.
3. Review the updated `index.html` locally.
4. (User Task) Set up a GitHub repository.
5. (User Task) Configure the repository for GitHub Pages.
6. (User Task) Commit and push `index.html`, the `resized/` directory, and the `memory-bank/` directory to the repository.

**Active Decisions & Considerations:**
- Start with embedded CSS for simplicity.
- Preserve the original external links for the book images (updated decision based on feedback).
- Use the pre-resized images available locally in the `resized/` directory.
- Ensure HTML structure is semantic and reflects the source content's hierarchy.

**Important Patterns & Preferences:**
- Maintain clear documentation in the Memory Bank.
- Follow standard HTML5 best practices.
- Keep the initial implementation simple and focused on core content migration.

**Learnings & Insights:**
- The source content is a blog post recommending books related to self-improvement themes.
- The key elements to migrate are the main text and the book cover images.
- The target is a simple static page suitable for GitHub Pages.
- Basic embedded CSS provides sufficient styling for readability.
- Using the `resized/` directory for images works as expected.
